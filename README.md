## Description
This is a simple calendar app for scheduling your work day. The app allows you to add important events to a daily planner so that you can manage your time effectively.

## Features
* Displays the current day at the top of the calendar
* Presents time blocks for standard business hours
* Color-codes each time block to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* Allows users to enter events for each time block and save them in local storage
* Retrieves any saved events from local storage and displays them in the appropriate time blocks
* Uses Day.js library for date and time manipulation

## Installation 
To use this app, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine. You will need to have jQuery and Day.js libraries included in your project.

## Usage
To use the app, open the index.html file in your web browser. You will see a calendar with time blocks for standard business hours. Each time block can be clicked on to enter an event. The Save button in each time block will save the entered event to local storage.

Any saved events will be retrieved from local storage and displayed in the appropriate time blocks. The current day will be displayed at the top of the calendar, and each time block will be color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
